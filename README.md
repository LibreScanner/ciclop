**Please note**: The original Ciclop design was made in Autodesk Inventor(tm) which is proprietary software. Since we love open formats we are migrating the Ciclop parts to [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org/), which is a multiplatform open source CAD software. We invite people from the community to join us and help us to complete the task.
